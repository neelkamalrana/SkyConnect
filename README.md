## ✈️ Project Overview

**SkyConnect** is an interactive web application that helps users find the **shortest flight path between any two international airports**. Originally a Java CLI tool, the project has been transformed into a full-stack application using **Spring Boot** on the backend and **React.js** for the frontend.

It leverages **Dijkstra’s Algorithm** to compute the shortest path and total distance between airports. The interface is simple and intuitive—ideal for educational, logistics, or travel-related applications.
